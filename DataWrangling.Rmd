This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


#Rebel Governance Data: Huang 2016, Power-Sharing (PS) Manually entered
#PS data comes from two different datasets which are not available online (Mukherjee 2006; Hartzell and Hoddie 2003).  I added it manually to the RGD before uploading the data, because power-sharing is one of my main variables.  There are only a small number of cases where it applies, so I used the lists of power-sharing countries from both articles to add a binary 0/1 for PS.  
library(readxl)
RgdPs <- read_excel("RgdPs.xlsx")

#Freedom House Data
#from Amanda Edgewell, Univ. of Florida, who has an online Excel version of FH scores with inverted Political Rights and Civil Liberties meaures.
FH <- read_excel("Editedfhrankings1973to2018.xlsx")

#renaming country codes to merge 
library(tidyverse)

colnames(FH)[colnames(FH)=="ccode"] <- "cowccode"

#Merging Rebel Data and FH by both year and code
RghFh <- merge(RgdPs, FH, by=c("year", "cowccode"))

#this returned an error, so I checked for missing values
#update: I found no missing values in the columns I am trying to merge

sum(is.na (RgdPs$year)) 
sum(is.na (FH$year))
sum(is.na (RgdPs$cowccode))

?merge

#Update: I found a typo in the code and corrected it.  The error was because the
#code read: RghFh <- merge(RgdPs, FH, by-c("year", "cowccode"))


#Looking the data over to check for total observations, obvious errors
view(RghFh)

#The protest data was in the dataset where I added the power-sharing variable, 
#but to be thorough, I wanted to write out the code I would have used if I
#needed it in here

#Mass Mobilization Dataset
MM <- read_excel("MM.xlsx")
View(MM)

#This data needs to be collapsed by country year so that it can be merged with the other data

library(dplyr)
MM2 <- MM %>% group_by(country, year, ccode) %>%
      summarize(protest = sum(protest))
view(MM2)

#I would then merge with the Rebel data, which I will list here as the one
# above.  This is for the sake of simplicity, I don't want to add another
#dataset to my repo that I don't use (but I still want to show the steps)

# RgdMM <- merge(Rgd, MM, by=c("year", "ccode"))

#The MM has data for more countried than I need, so I want to drop variables
#without civil wars

?drop_na

# RgdMM %>% drop_na(civwar)
